            <p>DS1 is the latest addition to the modular LED lighting systems family.</p>
            <p>As the youngest brother, it comes with a myriad of features built in, it is DMX/ArtNet ready and can be AC, DC or battery powered. As with all the rest of the family, a relatively small number of them will give you possibilities that never existed before. The DS1 is a set of one light module with all its’ accessories. All parts of the DS family are interchangeable. The DS1, DS3 and DS6 are built from the same components.</p>
            <h4>Upgradable</h4>
            <p>The entire system is built to last. Unfortunately, technology does not stay in one place over the years, devaluing your investment. We have designed the whole line of DS products to maintain their value by applying gradual software and hardware upgrades. Most hardware upgrades are available as kits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col col-50">
            <h4>Free Software</h4>
            <p>The cornerstone of DS innovation is the way in which we control these modules. You can control all your lights and their parameters from a phone app, which is simple and intuitive as using a box of crayons.</p>
            <h4>Super Luminous</h4>
            <p>The system provides RGB mixing of the highest quality, on par with professional colorist tools. DS lights are the only RGB LED solution able to challenge the output of widely used HMI technology.</p>

            <p>"One of my key concepts in creating an aesthetic for 'Ghost In The Shell’ was the rendering of a highly complex and original color palette. Digital Sputnik was an essential tool, both in the research and development of this concept and in its execution where they provided great precision and flexibility."</p>

            <p>Full three module set with a combined output of 300W. The DS3+ includes a DMX/RDM or ArtNet control handle and a flight case easy to organize.</p>
            <p>The modular diffuser boxes offer camouflage to hide individual LED source and form a singular, uniform light beam. The included holographic filters of various sizes are like smoke and mirrors. One way, they split the beam into 34 degrees, the other way, 76. DS3+ has exceptional communication skills with the included DMX/RDM or ArtNet handle. In family reunions, DS3+ is the most beloved sibling among all family members.</p>
            <h4>Modular Design</h4>
            <p>Modularity is our core philosophy. We like to think about light modules as if they were LEGO bricks; A relatively small number of them will give you versatility that never existed before. The possibility of connecting light modules to build any desired shape of light is game-changing.</p>
            <p>All the DS line products use the same interchangeable Light Module as the core of the system. Additionally, you can pick between a variety of accessories to shape the lighting fixture.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col col-50">
            <h4>Color Science</h4>
            <p>Using the same technology as post-production monitors, each light module has been factory calibrated with a profile saved into every module. Constant color coordinates are kept through the dimming range using high precision multi-dimensional LUTs.<br>All channels are 16bit flicker free current controlled with simple to operate four-channel HSL controls that allow dimming the light with the exact mixture of white balance and tint.</p>
            <h4>Hybrid Thermal Design</h4>
            <p>The system uses passive and active cooling for maximum efficiency. We keep the modules in constant temperature to minimize the fluctuations of output and color. It is possible to remotely control the fan speed over DMX/RDM or ArtNet.</p>

            <p>With this simple accessory, you can connect six DS3 systems into one single 1.8kw fixture. If a single Beam is not enough, you can bring in the football fans: Mount the beams side-by-side on the trussing to make installations of tens of KWs.</p>

            <p>The Spacelight is a proud member of the modular LED lighting systems for the film and television industries.<br>Modularity is our core philosophy and this easy accessory is exemplarily fit for more glamorous works. The spacelight can pack one or two DS3 units for substantial output. The fixture is usable without the skirt to get a more directional beam from higher ceilings.</p>
